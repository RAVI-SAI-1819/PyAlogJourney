    "# Reversing a List Using the Two-Pointer Technique\n",
    "In this question i used the two pointer do the in place operation of revering the give list or array.\n",
    "#### Concept Overview: Two-Pointer Technique\n",
    "The two-pointer technique is a common algorithmic approach where you use two indices (or \"pointers\") to traverse a data structure from opposite ends (or different starting points) simultaneously.\n",
    "In the case of reversing a list:\n",
    "- One pointer starts from the left (index 0)\n",
    "- One pointer starts from the right (index len(nums) - 1)\n",
    "- At each step, you swap the values at these pointers, then move them toward each other:\n",
    "- left += 1\n",
    "- right -= 1\n",
    "- This continues until the pointers meet or cross\n",
    "This is efficient: you only loop through half the list and use constant space (no extra memory).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Detailed Breakdown:\n",
    "- Initialize two pointers (l, r)\n",
    "left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1\n",
    "- left starts at the beginning of the list\n",
    "- right starts at the end\n",
    "- Loop until pointers cross\n",
    "while left < right:\n",
    "- We only need to reverse until the center is reached\n",
    "- Swap Operation\n",
    "```nums[left], nums[right] = nums[right], nums[left]```\n",
    "- This line is Pythonic syntactic sugar for swapping without using a temporary variable\n",
    "- It’s equivalent to:\n",
    "temp = nums[left]\n",
    "nums[left] = nums[right]\n",
    "nums[right] = temp\n",
    "- Move the pointers inward\n",
    "left += 1\n",
    "right -= 1\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Narrow the scope of reversal on each loop iteration\n",
